Pong, make the ball move

### Take Notes and Code
1. Mr. Gerwin will lecture about how to make the ball move or you can watch the video on Schoology
2. Code pong0-1.py so that it does what we did in class.
3. Save as pong0-2.py before making your enhancements.
4. Make the enhancements and upload pong0-1.py and pong0-2.py to your repository.

### Enhancements
1. Research RGB color codes and determine a new color to make the ball and the background.
2. Resize the window and the ball to your liking
3. Make the ball a speed that you think is appropriate for Pong

### Discussion Questions
1. Why is it important to have a timer.tick() event?
2. Explain why the screen has to be filled in with black before we draw the circle each time.
3. An outside observer might say that we made the ball move across the screen.  What is actually happening?
4. Why is it important to have a variable called ScreenSize?  Why can't we just use the numbers 800, 800 everywhere in the project?
